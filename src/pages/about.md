# About Embodied Processing at Transcend Body Therapy

At Transcend Body Therapy, we take a holistic approach to healing that honors the deep connection between body and mind. Our work is rooted in embodied processing, a therapeutic method that helps clients access and process emotions, trauma, and stress through physical sensations, breath, and mindful movement—often before words are even needed.

## Our Approach

Unlike traditional talk therapy that focuses primarily on thoughts, embodied processing works from the "bottom up"—recognizing that much of our emotional experience is first felt in the body. With the guidance of a trained therapist, clients learn to build somatic awareness, noticing sensations like tension, energy shifts, or areas of discomfort, and gently exploring the emotions connected to these physical cues.

## Our Methods

By integrating proven modalities such as Somatic Experiencing, Internal Family Systems (IFS), and Polyvagal Theory, we create a safe space where clients can move from states of overwhelm or dysregulation toward greater ease, balance, and emotional well-being.

## Benefits of Embodied Processing

Our therapeutic approach offers numerous benefits, including:

- Relief from trauma, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain
- A stronger sense of self-awareness and emotional clarity
- Improved nervous system regulation and stress resilience
- A deeper sense of presence and connection to the body
